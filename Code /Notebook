It seems like you have a lab assignment on image processing and you're looking for guidance, including a sample image, explanations of the concepts, and code examples to complete the tasks in a Jupyter Notebook. Let's break down each task and provide the necessary information.

Since I cannot directly generate or display images in a Jupyter Notebook, I'll provide you with the Python code using the OpenCV and NumPy libraries, which are standard for these types of tasks. You can run this code in your Jupyter Notebook to get the desired output.

First, you'll need to install the necessary libraries if you haven't already. You can do this using pip:

Bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
We'll use a sample image for all the tasks. A simple, well-known grayscale image like a portrait of Albert Einstein or a cameraman is a great choice for these exercises. For this guide, we'll assume you have an image named cameraman.tif in the same directory as your notebook. If you don't, you can easily find one online.

Python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# A helper function to display images
def display_images(images, titles):
    num_images = len(images)
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, num_images, figsize=(15, 5))
    if num_images == 1:
        axes = [axes]
    
    for ax, img, title in zip(axes, images, titles):
        ax.imshow(img, cmap='gray')
        ax.set_title(title)
        ax.axis('off')
    plt.show()

# Load the grayscale image
try:
    img = cv2.imread('cameraman.tif', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    if img is None:
        raise FileNotFoundError("Image file 'cameraman.tif' not found. Please provide a grayscale image.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading image: {e}")
    # Create a simple dummy image if not found for demonstration
    img = np.zeros((256, 256), dtype=np.uint8)
    for i in range(256):
        for j in range(256):
            img[i, j] = i
    print("Using a generated grayscale image for demonstration.")
    
print("Original image loaded. Shape:", img.shape)
display_images([img], ['Original Grayscale Image'])
1. Apply Image Quantization (Bit Reduction)

Concept: Image quantization, or bit reduction, is the process of decreasing the number of bits used to represent each pixel's intensity value. An 8-bit grayscale image has 2 
8
 =256 intensity levels (from 0 to 255). Reducing this to 4 bits means you'll have 2 
4
 =16 levels, and 2 bits means 2 
2
 =4 levels. This is done by dividing the original intensity range into fewer, larger intervals and assigning a single value (e.g., the midpoint of the interval) to all pixels within that range. This often results in a "posterized" or "banded" appearance.

Code:

Python
# Convert to 4 bits (16 levels)
# The formula is (original_value // (256/16)) * (256/16)
# Here, 256/16 = 16
quantized_4_bits = (img // 16) * 16

# Convert to 2 bits (4 levels)
# The formula is (original_value // (256/4)) * (256/4)
# Here, 256/4 = 64
quantized_2_bits = (img // 64) * 64

display_images([img, quantized_4_bits, quantized_2_bits],
               ['Original (8 bits)', 'Quantized (4 bits)', 'Quantized (2 bits)'])
2. Perform Image Shrinking

Concept: Image shrinking, or downsampling, reduces the dimensions of an image. Nearest-neighbor interpolation is the simplest method. For each new, smaller pixel, it finds the corresponding location in the original image and simply copies the intensity value of the nearest pixel. This method is fast but can introduce aliasing artifacts (jagged edges).

Code:

Python
# Shrink to half the original size
half_size = cv2.resize(img, None, fx=0.5, fy=0.5, interpolation=cv2.INTER_NEAREST)

# Shrink to one-fourth the original size
quarter_size = cv2.resize(img, None, fx=0.25, fy=0.25, interpolation=cv2.INTER_NEAREST)

display_images([img, half_size, quarter_size],
               ['Original Image', 'Shrunk (1/2 size)', 'Shrunk (1/4 size)'])
3. Perform Image Zooming

Concept: Image zooming, or upsampling, increases the dimensions of an image.

Nearest-neighbor interpolation: Similar to shrinking, this method finds the nearest pixel in the original image and assigns its value to the new pixel. It's fast but often results in a blocky, pixelated appearance because it simply duplicates pixels.

Bilinear interpolation: This method is more sophisticated. For each new pixel, it considers the four nearest pixels in the original image and calculates a weighted average of their intensity values. The weights are determined by the new pixel's distance from the surrounding original pixels. This results in a much smoother, less pixelated image compared to nearest-neighbor.

Code:

Python
# Assuming 'half_size' from the previous step is available
# Zoom the shrunk image back to the original size
original_h, original_w = img.shape[:2]

# Zoom using Nearest-neighbor interpolation
zoomed_nearest = cv2.resize(half_size, (original_w, original_h), interpolation=cv2.INTER_NEAREST)

# Zoom using Bilinear interpolation
zoomed_bilinear = cv2.resize(half_size, (original_w, original_h), interpolation=cv2.INTER_LINEAR)

display_images([zoomed_nearest, zoomed_bilinear],
               ['Zoomed (Nearest-Neighbor)', 'Zoomed (Bilinear)'])

print("Comparison: The nearest-neighbor zoomed image looks blocky and has jagged edges, as it simply replicated pixels. The bilinear zoomed image is smoother, but slightly blurry, as it interpolated new pixel values.")
4. Highlight 4-neighbors and 8-neighbors

Concept: In image processing, the "neighbors" of a pixel are the pixels immediately surrounding it.

4-neighbors: These are the pixels that share an edge with the central pixel (up, down, left, right).

8-neighbors: These include the 4-neighbors plus the pixels that share a corner (the four diagonal pixels).

Code:

Python
# Load or crop a small part of the image
small_img = img[100:105, 100:105].copy()
h, w = small_img.shape

# Define the center pixel and highlight it
center_row, center_col = h // 2, w // 2
highlighted_img = cv2.cvtColor(small_img, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR) # Convert to color for marking

# 4-neighbors (in red)
# [1,0], [-1,0], [0,1], [0,-1]
for dx, dy in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
    highlighted_img[center_row + dx, center_col + dy] = [0, 0, 255] # Red

# 8-neighbors (in blue) - includes the 4-neighbors as well
highlighted_8_img = cv2.cvtColor(small_img, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR)
for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
    for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
        if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
            continue
        highlighted_8_img[center_row + dx, center_col + dy] = [255, 0, 0] # Blue

# Mark the center pixel in both images (e.g., in green)
highlighted_img[center_row, center_col] = [0, 255, 0]
highlighted_8_img[center_row, center_col] = [0, 255, 0]

display_images([highlighted_img, highlighted_8_img],
               ['4-Neighbors (Red)', '8-Neighbors (Blue)'])
5. Create and Visualize a Binary Image

Concept: A binary image is an image where each pixel can only have one of two values, typically 0 (black) or 255 (white). It's created by applying a threshold: all pixels with an intensity value greater than the threshold are set to white, and all others are set to black. This process is useful for separating an object from its background.

Code:

Python
# Threshold the grayscale image (e.g., using 128 as the threshold)
threshold_value = 128
ret, binary_img = cv2.threshold(img, threshold_value, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

# Count white and black pixels
total_pixels = img.size
white_pixels = np.sum(binary_img == 255)
black_pixels = np.sum(binary_img == 0)

display_images([img, binary_img], ['Original Grayscale', 'Binary Image (Threshold 128)'])
print(f"Total pixels: {total_pixels}")
print(f"Number of white pixels: {white_pixels}")
print(f"Number of black pixels: {black_pixels}")
6. Histogram-Based Image Enhancement Techniques

Concept: A histogram of a grayscale image is a graph that shows the distribution of pixel intensities. A low-contrast image typically has a narrow histogram, meaning its pixel values are concentrated in a small range. Histogram equalization is a technique that aims to spread out the intensity values more evenly across the full range (0-255). This increases the global contrast of the image, making the details more visible.

Code:

Python
# Load a low-contrast image (or simulate one)
low_contrast_img = img.copy()
low_contrast_img = cv2.convertScaleAbs(low_contrast_img, alpha=0.5, beta=50)

# Original histogram
hist_orig = cv2.calcHist([low_contrast_img], [0], None, [256], [0, 256])

# Apply histogram equalization
equalized_img = cv2.equalizeHist(low_contrast_img)

# Equalized histogram
hist_eq = cv2.calcHist([equalized_img], [0], None, [256], [0, 256])

# Display images and histograms
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(15, 10))

# Original image and its histogram
axes[0, 0].imshow(low_contrast_img, cmap='gray')
axes[0, 0].set_title('Low-Contrast Image')
axes[0, 0].axis('off')
axes[0, 1].plot(hist_orig)
axes[0, 1].set_title('Original Histogram')
axes[0, 1].set_xlabel('Pixel Intensity')
axes[0, 1].set_ylabel('Frequency')

# Equalized image and its histogram
axes[1, 0].imshow(equalized_img, cmap='gray')
axes[1, 0].set_title('Equalized Image')
axes[1, 0].axis('off')
axes[1, 1].plot(hist_eq)
axes[1, 1].set_title('Equalized Histogram')
axes[1, 1].set_xlabel('Pixel Intensity')
axes[1, 1].set_ylabel('Frequency')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print("Analysis: The original histogram is narrow, showing that most pixel values are in a small range. The equalized histogram is much more spread out and flat, which corresponds to the enhanced contrast and improved visibility of details in the equalized image.")
7. 8-bit Image Slicing

Concept: Image slicing is a technique used to create a new binary image by highlighting pixels within a specific intensity range. Pixels inside the range are set to white (255), while those outside are set to black (0). This is useful for isolating and analyzing specific features or intensity levels within an image.

Code:

Python
# Define the intensity ranges
range1_low, range1_high = 0, 127
range2_low, range2_high = 129, 255

# Create the first binary image (highlighting 0-127)
sliced_img1 = np.zeros_like(img)
sliced_img1[(img >= range1_low) & (img <= range1_high)] = 255

# Create the second binary image (highlighting 129-255)
sliced_img2 = np.zeros_like(img)
sliced_img2[(img >= range2_low) & (img <= range2_high)] = 255

display_images([img, sliced_img1, sliced_img2],
               ['Original Image', 'Sliced (0-127)', 'Sliced (129-255)'])

print("Explanation:")
print(f"The first sliced image (0-127) highlights the darker regions of the original image, which often correspond to shadows or areas with less light.")
print(f"The second sliced image (129-255) highlights the brighter regions of the original image, which often correspond to highlights, bright objects, or well-lit areas.")
print("By looking at these two images, you can effectively separate the dark and light features of the scene.")
