üé® Image Processing
This repository contains the completed work for fundamental image processing techniques. The project explores various transformations and analyses, including bit reduction, spatial manipulation (shrinking and zooming), neighbor highlighting, and histogram-based enhancement.

‚ú® Features

This notebook demonstrates the following image processing concepts:

Image Quantization: Reduces the number of intensity levels (bits) to create a "posterized" effect, showcasing the impact on image quality.

Image Shrinking: Downsamples an image to half and one-fourth its original size using nearest-neighbor interpolation.

Image Zooming: Upsamples a previously shrunk image back to its original dimensions using both nearest-neighbor and bilinear interpolation, allowing for a visual comparison of the two methods.

Neighbor Highlighting: Identifies and marks the 4-neighbors and 8-neighbors of a central pixel in a small image.

Binary Image Creation: Converts a grayscale image to a binary format using a fixed threshold and counts the number of black and white pixels.

Histogram Equalization: Enhances the contrast of a low-contrast image by redistributing its pixel intensity values and visualizes the change in its histogram.

8-bit Image Slicing: Creates two binary images by isolating specific intensity ranges (e.g., dark and light regions) to highlight different features.

üíª Technologies Used

Python: The core programming language for the project.

OpenCV: A powerful library for computer vision and image processing tasks.

NumPy: Essential for numerical operations and efficient array manipulation.

Matplotlib: Used for visualizing images and plotting histograms.

üöÄ Setup

To run this project, you'll need a Python environment with the required libraries.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

Install the dependencies:

pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib

Add an image:
Place a grayscale image (e.g., cameraman.tif or my_image.png) in the root directory of the repository.

Open and run the notebook:
You can use Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code to open the .ipynb file and run the cells in sequence.

üìù Usage

The main file is enrollno_lab2.ipynb. Open this file in a Jupyter environment. The notebook is well-commented, with each section corresponding to a specific lab task. Simply run each code cell to see the output images and accompanying explanations.
